Reflection


  Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

    The DrivePass project was a small project for a company who wanted to create a system that allowed users to practice for their drivers test ahead of time as well as schedule in person sessions for training. The system needed to be online based, as users were expected to have access to the system 24/7 and from any location.

  What did you do particularly well?

    I identified the clients needs very well and was able to turn them into system requirements that I was then able to use to create the basic outline of the system.

  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    I would go back and revise my diagrams a bit. Now that I have completed so many,  I feel I would do better at making them a bit more organized. Looking back at them, I see some mistakes I made that made them a bit harder to read than they needed to be. The key is to simplify, so they are easily understood.

  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    To interpret the users needs, I read over a transcript multiple times and pulled out key requests. I then turned these requests into requirements which could be incorporated into the system design. It is very important to consider the user's needs when designing a system because if you don't, you could end up with a system that works but doesn't do anything that the user is requesting. That would be bad business.

  How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    Desiging software starts off with planning and creating diagrams. I used to believe it as more of a short planning session, but I have realized that a solid planning session really helps lay the groundwork and keep you focused and on track for what you're building. Without a basic outline, it's easy to keep expanding the systems scope and create something that you can never actually complete. In the future, I will certainly be utilzing diagrams much more for myself as well as others I try to share or explain my system to.
